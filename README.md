# BLOCKADE 

**Status / Progress**: Early setup complete. Beginning on the more advanced stuff on the road to 0.0.0 (minimum viable prototype). Will keep the repo private until at least 0.0.0, and then make it public once it's at that stage. The difference between 0.0.0 and 1.0.0 will be huge, with an unknowable amount of updates in between. ETA to 0.0.0 is maybe a week or two at most. ETA to 1.0.0 impossible to say, but if I follow through on all planned features then perhaps a year.

**Version**: pre-0.0.0 (literally the opening salvo)

**Description**: I am making a traditional Roguelike disguised as a Subsim, with the intent that it eventually be cozy to play with a plug-and-play controller. The goal is something in between Cold Waters and Silent Hunter, although set in a non-historical universe (procedurally generated each campaign, and likely with varying levels of technology between them), and which plays in the manner of a traditional Roguelike (a comparison can also be made to games like XCOM, Invisible Inc., and tactical wargames in general). Early, early stages. The stats-and-rolling system are a loosely adapted take on the way GURPS handles things, because that's pretty sweet. 

This game isn't intended to be a super accurate representation of submarine warfare (in which I'm not an expert). The goal is something that is close-ish, in a cartoon or anime-like way, at most. Most of the stats are placeholder stats which for now just serve to test the mechanics. Much testing will be done to ensure the best values later on.
